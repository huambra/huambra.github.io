														<h5><strong>Challenge</strong></h5>
														<p>Taisuki Taiyaki, a themed Japanese restaurant, hosts multiple
															events throughout the year to engage customers and
															strengthen brand loyalty. However, they lacked a structured
															approach to evaluating event performance. In 2021, the
															restaurant needed a comprehensive report analyzing a full
															year of event data to optimize future events and maximize
															sales impact. The challenge was to extract meaningful
															insights from historical data to improve decision-making.
														</p>
														<h5><strong>Our Approach</strong></h5>
														<p>I developed an event performance report by accessing and
															analyzing the restaurant’s historical data. The process
															involved identifying key metrics such as event duration,
															total sales per event, and daily sales average to assess
															success factors. Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI
															for transformation and visualization, I structured the data
															into a clear, actionable report. The analysis revealed that
															events lasting three weeks to a month yielded the highest
															returns, leading to a strategic adjustment in event
															planning.</p>
														<h5><strong>Results</strong></h5>
														<p>The insights derived from the report directly influenced
															Taisuki Taiyaki’s event strategy, leading to a 60% increase
															in sales during the first two events of the following year.
															The restaurant now leverages historical data to refine event
															planning, ensuring sustained engagement and revenue growth.
														</p>
														<h5><strong>Future Plans</strong></h5>
														<p>The next step involves integrating real-time tracking and
															customer feedback analysis to further enhance event
															effectiveness. Expanding the report’s scope to include
															seasonal trends and customer behavior patterns will allow
															for more precise strategic adjustments.</p>
														<h5><strong>Expertise</strong></h5>
														<p>My background in data analysis, SQL, and Power BI was
															essential in transforming raw event data into actionable
															insights. By structuring event performance metrics, I
															provided a data-driven decision-making framework that
															optimized event planning and maximized sales potential.</p>

														<h5><strong>Challenge</strong></h5>
														<p>Taisuki Taiyaki, a restaurant specializing in taiyaki, was
															storing sales data but lacked a functional dashboard for
															decision-making. Without clear visibility into peak hours,
															the restaurant risked inefficient staffing, leading to
															unnecessary operational costs. The goal was to develop a
															sales dashboard to identify sales trends and adjust
															operating hours accordingly.</p>
														<h5><strong>Our Approach</strong></h5>
														<p>To tackle this challenge, we designed a custom sales
															dashboard to analyze the restaurant’s data. The project
															involved extracting raw data using SQL, applying
															transformations in Power BI, and visualizing key metrics
															such as total sales per month, daily revenue trends, and
															product-specific performance. By interpreting these
															insights, we identified periods where sales did not meet the
															break-even point. After presenting the findings, the
															restaurant adjusted its schedule, optimizing staff
															allocation.</p>
														<h5><strong>Results</strong></h5>
														<p>The sales dashboard enabled data-driven decision-making,
															leading to a reduction of two operating hours on Tuesdays
															and Fridays, when sales were consistently low. This
															adjustment resulted in a 16% decrease in personnel costs,
															improving overall efficiency while maintaining service
															quality.</p>
														<h5><strong>Future Plans</strong></h5>
														<p>The next step is to expand the dashboard’s functionality by
															integrating inventory tracking and customer behavior
															analytics. These enhancements will further refine
															operational strategies and improve cost management.</p>
														<h5><strong>Expertise</strong></h5>
														<p>Our team, specializing in data analytics and business
															intelligence, leveraged SQL and Power BI to transform raw
															sales data into actionable insights. The result was a
															scalable, interactive solution that streamlined
															decision-making and optimized restaurant operations.</p>

														<h5><strong>Challenge</strong></h5>
														<p>This project was part of my Data Science capstone at
															CoderHouse, where we worked with public data from Olist, a
															Brazilian marketplace and logistics platform for small and
															medium enterprises in Mexico and Brazil. The goal was to
															develop a predictive model capable of forecasting customer
															reviews based on the available data. The challenge was to
															clean, analyze, and structure the dataset to build a
															reliable classification model.</p>
														<h5><strong>Our Approach</strong></h5>
														<p>We began by defining the project requirements and accessing
															the dataset. Using Python, we performed data cleaning,
															preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to
															understand key patterns and relationships. Once the dataset
															was structured, we applied various classification
															algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and
															XGBoost, comparing their performance to determine the best
															model. After thorough evaluation, Random Forest was selected
															as the final model, and we documented the entire development
															process for future improvements.</p>
														<h5><strong>Results</strong></h5>
														<p>While the model was not production-ready, it provided a solid
															foundation for customer review prediction, highlighting key
															variables influencing ratings. The project successfully
															demonstrated machine learning applications in e-commerce,
															and all team members earned their Data Science certification
															upon completion.</p>
														<h5><strong>Future Plans</strong></h5>
														<p>Further refinements include hyperparameter tuning, feature
															engineering, and deep learning integration to improve
															accuracy. Expanding the dataset and incorporating sentiment
															analysis on customer feedback could also enhance predictive
															capabilities.</p>
														<h5><strong>Expertise</strong></h5>
														<p>My experience in machine learning, Python, and model
															evaluation was key to structuring the project. By applying
															classification algorithms and data science best practices,
															we developed a scalable and reproducible predictive model
															for customer sentiment analysis.</p>

														<h5><strong>Challenge</strong></h5>
														<p>The Ecuadorian shrimp industry is highly dependent on global
															markets such as the United States, China, and the European
															Union. However, fluctuations in demand, price variations,
															and regulatory changes create uncertainty, making it
															difficult for exporters to plan production efficiently.
															Without a predictive tool, companies struggle to anticipate
															market trends, impacting competitiveness and profitability.
															This project aimed to develop a data-driven forecasting
															model to optimize decision-making in the industry.</p>
														<h5><strong>Our Approach</strong></h5>
														<p>I developed a predictive model using SARIMA, Random Forest,
															and LSTM neural networks to estimate shrimp export trends.
															The process involved collecting historical export data
															(2011–2024) from Trademap.org, cleaning and structuring the
															dataset, and training models to identify patterns in
															exports. I then implemented a web application to visualize
															historical trends and future predictions, allowing industry
															stakeholders to make informed decisions about resource
															allocation and market strategy.</p>
														<h5><strong>Results</strong></h5>
														<p>The model successfully identified key export trends, with
															LSTM networks demonstrating the highest accuracy, especially
															in volatile markets like China. These insights enable better
															production planning, helping businesses reduce uncertainty
															and optimize export strategies to remain competitive in the
															global market.</p>
														<h5><strong>Future Plans</strong></h5>
														<p>Further improvements include integrating external variables
															such as economic indicators and climate conditions to
															enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, expanding the web
															application to support real-time data updates will provide
															even greater strategic value to industry stakeholders.</p>
														<h5><strong>Expertise</strong></h5>
														<p>My experience in machine learning, time series forecasting,
															and data visualization was critical in developing this
															solution. By combining statistical and deep learning
															techniques, I created a scalable and adaptable forecasting
															framework for economic and industry analysis.</p>

														<h5><strong>Challenge</strong></h5>
														<p>As part of Platzi’s 2024 Hackathon on AI in Education, I
															collaborated with a team of five in a highly competitive
															environment, where we tackled the challenge of improving
															access to personalized educational content. From thousands
															of applicants, I was selected within the top 100 and took on
															the role of Data Science and AI Architecture Specialist. Our
															goal was to create an intelligent assistant capable of
															dynamically generating learning experiences tailored to
															individual users.</p>
														<h5><strong>Our Approach</strong></h5>
														<p>We developed MIA (My Intelligent Assistant), an AI-powered
															tool that generates structured courses based on users'
															interests and expertise. The system initiates an interactive
															survey to assess learning goals, preferred content formats,
															and difficulty levels. Leveraging OpenAI’s API, MIA
															generates modular content in Markdown, integrating
															theoretical concepts, exercises, and real-world projects. I
															was responsible for designing the AI system architecture,
															integrating OpenAI with Azure for cloud deployment, and
															optimizing prompt engineering and content generation
															strategies.</p>
														<h5><strong>Results</strong></h5>
														<p>The MVP was successfully tested with real users, validating
															its effectiveness in creating personalized learning paths.
															The project demonstrated the potential of AI in adaptive
															education, providing a scalable and structured solution for
															content generation.</p>
														<h5><strong>Future Plans</strong></h5>
														<p>The next step involves refining MIA’s adaptability, improving
															real-time feedback integration, and enhancing multi-platform
															compatibility to expand its educational impact.</p>
														<h5><strong>Expertise</strong></h5>
														<p>My expertise in AI architecture, data science, and cloud
															computing was crucial in ensuring MIA’s performance,
															scalability, and seamless integration, making personalized
															education more accessible and dynamic.</p>

										<p><em>Last Updated: [Insert Date]</em></p>

										<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
										<p>RendonLuis LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your
											privacy. We provide AI automation solutions to
											empower businesses to optimize operations and improve productivity. Our core
											service is developing custom AI agents
											that automate responses to customer inquiries. For example, our AI agents
											may be integrated with a client’s
											Instagram account to facilitate efficient communication with their audience.
											This Privacy Policy outlines how we
											collect, use, share, and protect your information.</p>

										<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
