#### 1. Event's Report (Taisuki Taiyaki)
**Category:** Data Analysis

**Challenge:** Taisuki Taiyaki, a themed Japanese restaurant, hosts multiple events throughout the year to engage customers and strengthen brand loyalty. However, they lacked a structured approach to evaluating event performance. In 2021, the restaurant needed a comprehensive report analyzing a full year of event data to optimize future events and maximize sales impact. The challenge was to extract meaningful insights from historical data to improve decision-making.

**Our Approach:** I developed an event performance report by accessing and analyzing the restaurant's historical data. The process involved identifying key metrics such as event duration, total sales per event, and daily sales average to assess success factors. Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for transformation and visualization, I structured the data into a clear, actionable report. The analysis revealed that events lasting three weeks to a month yielded the highest returns, leading to a strategic adjustment in event planning.

**Results:** The insights derived from the report directly influenced Taisuki Taiyaki's event strategy, leading to a 60% increase in sales during the first two events of the following year. The restaurant now leverages historical data to refine event planning, ensuring sustained engagement and revenue growth.

**Future Plans:** The next step involves integrating real-time tracking and customer feedback analysis to further enhance event effectiveness. Expanding the report's scope to include seasonal trends and customer behavior patterns will allow for more precise strategic adjustments.

**Expertise:** My background in data analysis, SQL, and Power BI was essential in transforming raw event data into actionable insights. By structuring event performance metrics, I provided a data-driven decision-making framework that optimized event planning and maximized sales potential.

#### 2. Sales Dashboard (Taisuki Taiyaki)
**Category:** Data Visualization

**Challenge:** Taisuki Taiyaki, a restaurant specializing in taiyaki, was storing sales data but lacked a functional dashboard for decision-making. Without clear visibility into peak hours, the restaurant risked inefficient staffing, leading to unnecessary operational costs. The goal was to develop a sales dashboard to identify sales trends and adjust operating hours accordingly.

**Our Approach:** To tackle this challenge, we designed a custom sales dashboard to analyze the restaurant's data. The project involved extracting raw data using SQL, applying transformations in Power BI, and visualizing key metrics such as total sales per month, daily revenue trends, and product-specific performance. By interpreting these insights, we identified periods where sales did not meet the break-even point. After presenting the findings, the restaurant adjusted its schedule, optimizing staff allocation.

**Results:** The sales dashboard enabled data-driven decision-making, leading to a reduction of two operating hours on Tuesdays and Fridays, when sales were consistently low. This adjustment resulted in a 16% decrease in personnel costs, improving overall efficiency while maintaining service quality.

**Future Plans:** The next step is to expand the dashboard's functionality by integrating inventory tracking and customer behavior analytics. These enhancements will further refine operational strategies and improve cost management.

**Expertise:** Our team, specializing in data analytics and business intelligence, leveraged SQL and Power BI to transform raw sales data into actionable insights. The result was a scalable, interactive solution that streamlined decision-making and optimized restaurant operations.

#### 3. Machine Learning (Olist)
**Category:** Data Science

**Challenge:** This project was part of my Data Science capstone at CoderHouse, where we worked with public data from Olist, a Brazilian marketplace and logistics platform for small and medium enterprises in Mexico and Brazil. The goal was to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting customer reviews based on the available data. The challenge was to clean, analyze, and structure the dataset to build a reliable classification model.

**Our Approach:** We began by defining the project requirements and accessing the dataset. Using Python, we performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and relationships. Once the dataset was structured, we applied various classification algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, comparing their performance to determine the best model. After thorough evaluation, Random Forest was selected as the final model, and we documented the entire development process for future improvements.

**Results:** While the model was not production-ready, it provided a solid foundation for customer review prediction, highlighting key variables influencing ratings. The project successfully demonstrated machine learning applications in e-commerce, and all team members earned their Data Science certification upon completion.

**Future Plans:** Further refinements include hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and deep learning integration to improve accuracy. Expanding the dataset and incorporating sentiment analysis on customer feedback could also enhance predictive capabilities.

**Expertise:** My experience in machine learning, Python, and model evaluation was key to structuring the project. By applying classification algorithms and data science best practices, we developed a scalable and reproducible predictive model for customer sentiment analysis.

#### 4. Shrimp Export Forecasting (Ecuadorian Shrimp Industry)
**Category:** Data Science

**Challenge:** The Ecuadorian shrimp industry is highly dependent on global markets such as the United States, China, and the European Union. However, fluctuations in demand, price variations, and regulatory changes create uncertainty, making it difficult for exporters to plan production efficiently. Without a predictive tool, companies struggle to anticipate market trends, impacting competitiveness and profitability. This project aimed to develop a data-driven forecasting model to optimize decision-making in the industry.

**Our Approach:** I developed a predictive model using SARIMA, Random Forest, and LSTM neural networks to estimate shrimp export trends. The process involved collecting historical export data (2011â€“2024) from Trademap.org, cleaning and structuring the dataset, and training models to identify patterns in exports. I then implemented a web application to visualize historical trends and future predictions, allowing industry stakeholders to make informed decisions about resource allocation and market strategy.

**Results:** The model successfully identified key export trends, with LSTM networks demonstrating the highest accuracy, especially in volatile markets like China. These insights enable better production planning, helping businesses reduce uncertainty and optimize export strategies to remain competitive in the global market.

**Future Plans:** Further improvements include integrating external variables such as economic indicators and climate conditions to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, expanding the web application to support real-time data updates will provide even greater strategic value to industry stakeholders.

**Expertise:** My experience in machine learning, time series forecasting, and data visualization was critical in developing this solution. By combining statistical and deep learning techniques, I created a scalable and adaptable forecasting framework for economic and industry analysis.
